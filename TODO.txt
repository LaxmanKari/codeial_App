.......................TODO LIST..............................

Here’s the list of things you need to do:
a) Add Noty to all the request responses

b) Show the user's name with the post added dynamically 

HINT: Use populate for getting the user, but remember to not send user’s password back in the response!

c) Add AJAX deletion to all the posts which are already present on the page (before adding a new one)

HINT: Very simple: Reuse the function created, just loop over all the delete links for posts on the page and call it for each of them!

d) Add/Remove comments dynamically with AJAX

HINT: Figure it out on your own! There’s just one tricky case which you’ll automatically find out
